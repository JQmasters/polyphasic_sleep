## Log

- 2am: failed to fall asleep. But still get up after 20 minutes.
- 3 am: will the meal plan (divided to 6 meals) do harm to my stomach? 
  - Google it. The stomach empties itself within 1-4 hours, depending on the kind of food. It’s definitely harmful to overeat. But there is no consensus about regular short amount of eating. 
  - Based on my feeling, I feel good with my stomach. No ache, no acid reflux.
  - So keep this meal plan.
- 4:23 am Hard to think. Muscle slightly hearts.
- 9:51am Fail to get up at 6:20am. The reason is, at first 10 minutes, I was worried if I can’t fall asleep. So I got up to extend the timer to 30 minutes. Didn’t hear the alarms. I slept from 6 am to 9:51 am. Feel terrible and hesitated to continue the crazy sleep plan. But it feels less anxious about sleep deprivation when I realized another sleep slot at 2pm soon.
    - Feel cold and chilled. The current temperature of room is 23 ℃. Normally I should feel good.
    - Body temperature is 36.0℃, decreased by 0.6 ℃ than my normal body temperature. 
    - Turn on the heater and dress warmer. Feel better.
- 11:49am Short memory lost. I forgot things much more quickly than ever. Less creative.
- 1:06 pm: body temperature returned to 36.5 ℃. Feel better.
- 2:43 pm: After another 20-minutes, feel refreshed. Total time is 22 minutes. Feel hungry and have one meal.
    - The internal organs felt tired. Wired. Hard to describe the current feeling. Feel like sick.
- 4:19 pm Starving and ate one box of strawberries. I ate too many. Half box should be better.
- 6 pm: Sleeping from 5:30 pm to 5:55 pm. Feel good even though I think I didn’t fall asleep during this 25 minutes.
- 10:46pm Sleep 25 minutes. I don’t feel hungry but still ate one orange.
- 1:20am (Mar. 17): Feel not bad but boring. I continued to work on research and programming for more than 10 hours (should be) and felt boring about it. Definitely need to find other things to do.
