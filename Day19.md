## Log

- 4:26am: I thought I had  a bad 22-minute sleep, so when awake, I tried to fall into another 22-mute sleep. Failed. It’s not possible.

    - So when experiencing a bad sleep, get up first. When feeling tired again, try the second 22-minute sleep. Due to the bad previous sleep, the second one should come earlier. It’s okay to ignore the time schedule. Sleep based on the feeling.

- 2:59pm: Slept from 10:51am to 2:59pm, around 4h2min, again. The alarms were going off, but I didn’t hear it.

        Almost every day, I need a sleep about 4h30min, when I feel very sleepy or tired. Then take another four shorter sleeps  (22-minutes) , to make a total sleep around 6.5h to 7 h.
        - It seems that I can’t make the previous polyphasic sleep mode work. I will experience sleep depreciation. My body will force to have a longer sleep.

- So, let me conclude this experiment:

    - First, to sleep 22-minute every 4 hours (polyphasic sleep) doesn’t work for me. I can’t get enough recovery. I was excited at first, and feel it’s possible, but gradually, my body tends to have its only way to get enough sleep by ignoring the alarms.
    - But polyphasic sleep does help to recover from minor tiredness. 4.5 hour sleep at night, then four 22-minutes sleep equally distributed around the day seems much more applicable. 
    - It’s also possible that I didn’t follow the strict polyphasic sleep plan. So my body doesn’t know it should adjust itself to adapt. 

- I will stop this experiment temporarily. In the future, when I find another available period of time for more restrict polyphasic sleep, I will try it again.

- New sleep mode is: at night, sleep 4.5h, for example, 2-6:30am, then 10am, 2pm, 6pm, take 22-minute sleeps.
