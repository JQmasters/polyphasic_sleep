## Introduction

First, what is **polyphasic sleep**. Polyphasic sleep means to divide the whole sleep to several parts and arrange them within 24 hours. There are several modes. Here I select to sleep **22 minutes every 4 hours**. This means, I will sleep six times and 2.2 hours in total per 24 hours.

Second, why do I choose this. It has been said that Leonardo da Vinci slept 20 minutes every 4 hours in his life. I have been curious about this sleep pattern when I was young. Recently due to COVID-19, I am working from home, which makes the polyphasic sleep pattern possible. Besides, [Steven Pavlina](https://stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/) published his blogs about the same sleep pattern in 2005. He followed this by several months without health and mental problems. The last reason is that I always feel anxious about the low efficiency of time management. Previously, I sleep 7-8 hours per day, with 4 - 5 hours for cooking and house keeping, and 2-3 hours for entertainment. So I only can work 7-8 hours per day. In a word, now is the best time to try this sleep pattern out.

Last, what is this note for? This note is to record my experiences in detail. In this README file, I intend to summarize a “best plan” for me when performing polyphasic sleep mode. I hope this plan could also be useful to others, although it is definitely filled in with my personal habits.

## Prerequisites

- [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#:~:text=The%20Pomodoro%20Technique%20is%20a,length%2C%20separated%20by%20short%20breaks.): for months and maybe more than a year, I have been working under this time management. Every "25 minutes", I will stop for a short rest.  The working intervals are not strict to be “25 minutes”. Just follow the principle that **take rest before feeling tired or boring**.
- [GTD task management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done): I started to learn this on 2019. It took me several months and maybe one year to finally get used to it. The main point of GTD is to let the GTD tools collect all your ideas, plans, worries, etc. By clearing your mind and only focus on one task at each time interval, the work efficiency reaches the highest. Currently, I use the software [“OmniFocus 3”](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/ios) software on Mac and iPhone. From last month, I moved the housekeeping and cooking tasks to paper notes (sticky notes), instead of writing them into OmniFocus anymore. There are several other cheaper replacements for OmniFocus 3 on Mac/Windows, but  I didn’t use the others much.
- Software for time tracking: I use an iPhone software called “TimeGolden” to track every minute spent per day. I listed an example of time tracking. For each category, it’s purely consumed time. Aleksandr Lyubishchev (Apr. 5, 1890 — Aug. 31, 1972), a Russian entomologist, had tried the similar time tracking in his almost whole life. At that time, he could only count the time based on his watch. Thanks for the modern smart phone and excellent softwares. 
    - **Work** includes not only my Ph.D. research, but also learning new stuffs,  writing notes and dairies, googling stuffs, ect. But they all should be serious work. 
    - **Exercise** includes all physical exercises, like running, walking, yoga, massage, muscle training, shopping in grocery store, exercise between the Pomodoro intervals, etc. They are all related to relax and strength my body.
    - **Chores** includes cooking, having meals, shower, laundry, brushing teeth, washing face, etc. They are all related to maintain a clean and heathy life.
    - **Reading** includes reading classic literatures, not scientific ones nor textbooks for learning purposes. This is a new hobby. I used to read classic literatures when I was a kid. Then abandon it due to limited time. According to `Day3.md`, now that I need some hobbies to maintain my interests on work. Reading is the best one after serious comparison. I also thought to learn playing pianos, but I have no experience at all. Definitely I will get frustrated by the difficulty to learn it alone, so postponed it to the future plan.
    - **Fun** includes playing games, watching videos, playing card games with roommates, group social activities, etc. They are related to have fun. 

Here is only one example

-  **Sleep plan**: For each sleep, set a timer of **22 minutes**. This include the time of lying down on bed and get up to switch off the alarm. Put the iPhone near the light switch. Then every time when I turn off the alarms, turn the light on first. Light helps to wake me up.
    - This plan can be brought forward or backward by at maximum 1 hour. This is to accommodate the meetings and seminars. 
    - The blogger Steven said it can be 2 hours at maximum, but I have not tested it. 
- **Meal plan**: I select to make the meals per day for one time. Take **400 g** for each meal after getting up. Only the meal for 6:30am is different. Two roasted whole grain bread, milk with whole grains (including soybeans,  millet, oat and sesame), two boiled eggs, one piece of dietary supplement (vitamins and minerals). Two purposes to this choice. First to make the meal plan diverse. Second, to indicate a starting point of a day for psychological reasons. Otherwise, there will not be an obvious start and end for one day, which making life an endless circle, which is horrible.
    - **Recipe**: 1000 g different kinds of vegetables, 500 g protein (chicken breast and soft tofu), 300 g cooked white rice. Cook the vegetables, chicken breast and tofu in boiling water. Make them a **salad** with salt, soy sauce and olive oil.  Store this in refrigerator and use microwave oven to reheat before each meal.
    - **Temporarily remove vinegar and potatoes. Consider to remove potatoes forever.** 
    - In this meal plan, I ensure the fulfillment of nutritions each day. Try to cut down the amount of saturated fatty acids (which are believed to harm the metabolic health) and the amount of sugar (in order to maintain a flat blood sugar concentration). 
- **The secret to fall asleep quickly**:
    - Any worries and thoughts can ruin a good sleep. So write them down before sleep, or even make a short plan to deal with it. Try to remove every thought or anxiety from the mind.
    - Turn off all lights or wear eye cover if it’s not dark enough. Wear earplugs. Wear less clothes and walk around the bed until the first yawn comes. 
        - Walk with less clothes is to lower the temperature of body surface. It’s found that the large temperature difference between the body surface and inner side can make you fall asleep more easily. Walk also makes the muscles tired and to fall into relaxation status more quickly. Try not to walk relaxed without getting the body temperature high. And be careful when moving in the dark. Darkness tells the brain to produce melatonins and to get ready for sleep. The yawn can be viewed as a sign ready for sleep, which can work as an ideomotor effect (psychological reason), making you believe that you can sleep very well. Belief makes miracles.
    - Lie down on bed. Adjust the postures until feeling comfortable. Focus on every breathe, and try to slow it down and make the breath shallow. In deep sleep, the breath is very light. Try to relax the whole body into the soft bed. Meditate in the heart, “relax and slow down.” Repeat it again and again until the end of sleep.
        - After practicing this several times, you can get the right feeling. You will gradually lose the sense to outside sound and heat. Then lose consciousness and fall asleep.
- Avoid any yoga, physical training or massage 1 hour before sleep. I found that they make me harder to fall asleep. They can remove the tiredness and get me excited again. But I need the tiredness to help me fall asleep quickly. 
- **Massage** on neck, back, waist, and eyes, when they hurt or are uncomfortable.
- Happiness is more important than success. Enjoy every day, and every hour. Success will come when it should.
