## Summary of today

- Didn’t make polyphasic sleep work today. I fell to sleep during 2:16am to 8:20am. A longer time of sleep made me feel more relaxed and more willing to have fun instead of work, according to my feelings. But there was little different with physical health according to my feeling only. I am waiting for the blood pressure monitor. So I still select polyphasic sleep mode.
- I Improved my GTD task management to adapt to polyphasic mode.
- Walk in the morning made feel quite better. Append this to a new habit for every day.
- Feel high stomach acid. Massage helped. 
- New finding about polyphasic sleep is that I experience a faster runout of brainpower than after a long sleep. And this makes sense, but could not be one reason that I abandon the polyphasic sleep. Instead, it has advantage that polyphasic sleep has higher time efficiency at recovery of brainpower than longer sleeps. 

- Physical data:

- | Heart rate /min | Temperature, ℃ | Weight, Kg |      |
    | --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---- |
    | 72              | 36.4           | 77.85      |      |

    Time consumption is not that important. In the future, I will pay less attention to this part. The health (physical, mental and psychological) and happiness matter much more.

## Log

- 8:37am: I Fell a sleep by accident without alarms from 2:16am to 8:20am when I was leaning on a pillow. As this is out of consciousness and expectation, I didn’ prepare a good condition for sleeping. The posture was bad, with leaning on the pillow and the light was on. 
    
    - From this, I think it’s not difficult to switch back to the monophasic sleep mode. I would expect it much easier to keep a monophasic sleep than a polyphasic one.
    - I think currently it’s a good time to compare my feeling and thoughts about these two sleep modes. In the polyphasic sleep, I was feeling more stressful, more restrict, less patient, more aggressive, more energetic, more likely to work, compared to the monophasic one. Monophasic sleep makes feel more relaxed, mainly the mental and psychological relaxation, close to be lazy. I would more like to have fun during the monophasic sleep, while in polyphasic sleep mode, having fun seems like to be another task, less stressful, little productive, which is not preferred. But I don’t think I can’t feel relaxed during monophasic,. It’s just more difficult to balance the tendacy of work and the willingness to have fun.
    -  I expect there is little difference on physical health. Take the feeling of stomach for example. During this monophasic, I slept for 6 hours without eating food. I can’t feel hungry, but this doesn’t mean that my stomach really stopped working and movements during my sleep. I just can’t feel it. The stomach acid is there, but it’s possible that stomach stops or reduces to produce acid during sleep time. When I got up at 8:37am, it took about 22 minutes for me to feel hungry, strong and sudden. I don’t think my stomach stopped to emit signals and responses to my brain during this 22 minutes. I just can’t feel it probably. After the same meal of bread, milk and eggs, I didn’t feel more comfortable than when I ate the same after polyphasic sleep. I still need to take hydrotalcite tablets to control the high acid.
    - After comparing these two sleep modes, I will choose the polyphasic, instead of the monophasic one, as long as my time schedule does accommodate to others. 
    
- 9:59am: I think my GTD task management system has to be improved. It can’t fulfill the highly efficient time schedule at polyphasic sleep. The input task can’t be processed quickly, which worries me all the time and increases my mental stress.   

- 10:50am: Took a 30-minute walk. Feel good now.

- 12:49pm: feel tired and sleepy. 4 hours after I got up from a 6-hour sleep, while I usually feel tired after 2-3 hours after I got up from a 20-minute sleep. See. A sleep  as long as 6 hours waste a lot to time to maintain a high interest and happiness.

- 2:50pm: Back to polyphasic sleep pattern. Just finish a 22-minute sleep and have a meal of 350 g salad. 

    - I need to check my task management GTD system. Feel that the previous arrangement couldn’t take full use of the elongated awake time. And I can potentially make me happier with an upgraded GTD system. More details are discussed in the note of `OmniFocus3.md`

- 3:21pm: Feel more relaxed, more used, and much happier to this polyphasic sleep time schedule. I am starting to enjoy it. 

- 3:29pm: Still have the problem with stomach acid. Consider to reduce the amount of protein and rice.

    - Try ginger water: put a thin slice in a large cup of hot water. When the water cools down, drink it.
    - Try to drink more water.
    - This acid reflux could be due to the change of time schedule. If so, I believe it will disappear after my body gets used to the polyphasic sleep mode.
    - Increase the time of physical exercise. I have included walking at least 30 minutes in the morning everyday. Try to do yoga in the afternoon or midnight.
    - Try massage on the stomach.

- 4:28pm: After massage on my belly, burp a lot and then I feel much better. Now I see, because I am eating more food than previous days (now 2 Kg, compared to previous 1.6 Kg), my fragile digestive system got overwhelmed. Massage and physical exercise can help to fix it.

- 6:35pm: It’s true that body starts to get used to the new time schedule, only 5 days!

    - At the time for sleeping, I can easily fall into deep sleep.
    - And after practicing the skills for sleep, now I can 100% fall into deep sleep, and wake up with the timer.

- 1:30am (Mar. 21): Finish a standard deep sleep from 10:10pm to 10:34pm. Then play card games until 1:07am without any interval rest, lasting 2h33min. Feel tired at the last half hour. This tiredness was stronger than normal tiredness when I slept from 10:30pm to 6 am and played card game for 4-5 hours. I speculate that a short 20-minute sleep can only recover energies for a short period lasting several hours, while a 7.5-hour sleep in monophasic sleep mode can offer enough energies, lasting for 18 hours, although I can still feel tired at night when monophasic sleep is used. 

    - Well, the polyphasic sleep mode does sacrifice something, related to a long period endurance for tiredness. Our body and brain seem to have made a huge storage of brainpower and bodypower during the 7.5-hour sleep, which the 20-minute sleep can’t make. 
    - So this could become an criteria to determine whether the polyphasic sleep mode can be applicable to you. If you can sleep every 4 hours, and have a full and restrict control on your sleep mode, then you can try it. It’s not difficult to follow. Instead, refreshing your body and brain 6 times per day can make you feel energetic for a longer time. But if you are in the situation that you must work for a long time without good rest, try to sleep longer and the polyphasic sleep mode probably is not a good choice for you.
