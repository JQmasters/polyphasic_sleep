## Summary of today

- I easily felt hungry today, not because the short amount of meal, but because too much starch. So remove potatoes from my salad recipe and keep the weight of each meal to be 350 g. 
- Summary today’s time map. 

| Date  | Work     | Sleep   | Exercise | Chores  | Reading | Fun   |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| 03-19 | 12h22min | 2h29min | 1h18min  | 6h13min | 1h10min | 24min |

- Add `Walk`   `7:30am - 8:30am` every day.
- Body data of today:
    - Body temperature 36.4 ℃, weight  77.15 Kg, heart rate 68 - 72/min.
- Feeling happy is more important than extending the work time. Try hard to find happiness, instead of finishing more tasks. The former can increase work efficiency, but the latter makes me feel tired and anxious, which causes burnout easily.
- Sleep before important meetings, instead of after.

## Log

- 2:39am, body weight 77.15 Kg, before meal. 
- 2:52am, meal 360 g salad. 
- 3:00am, Body temperature 36.3 after meal.
- 4:42am, Feel good but bored. Switch to Reading.
- 5:20am, Very hungry. If this often happens, consider to insert another fruit at 5 am.
- 5:29am:  Eat one apple and one orange. That’s too much. From now one, define one apple or one orange or half box of strawberries to be one serve. Never have more than one serve fruit even when I feel starving. Stomach will lie when it’s too hungry. 
    - I am back to work. Reading does help to get my interests back.
- 6:36am: Delay the sleep to now, due to work issues. 
- 7:28am: Sleep quality is not very good, because the annoying technical issue, which seems very simple and silly, but I just couldn’t work it out before sleep. Feel frustrated. I should have stopped earlier, and spent the rest of time to make me happy, in order to have a high quality sleep.
    - Now, choose to walk outside to see if walk will help to make my mind more clear. 
    - No coffee is considered. It has been proved that caffeine can reduce the amount of deep sleep. So no coffee, coke, or anything containing caffeine.
- 8:29am: Walked for 54min, about 3 Km. Feel better now. Walk really helps, or maybe the cold air helps to clear my mind.
    - I also found to be more energetic in my muscles and the whole body. I feel a little stronger than usual. Feel more strength when walking. Feel higher accuracy on movement control. Not sure what’s the reason here. Why much shorter sleep can help to increase the physical abilities? It seems that the deep sleep helps the muscle to recover. But if so, why do we need to sleep 7-8 hours? What’s the function of the rest of sleep time ?
- 9:23am: Feel tired, but better than yesterday. Walk from 7:30am to 8:30am is useful. Insert it to the time schedule.
- 11:10am: Feel confused whether did I brush the teeth and wash my face. I need to fix the time for them. 10:30 pm after meal and 6:30am after meal. This would follow the usual time arrangement, when I went to bed at 10:30am and get up at 6am. 
- 12:54pm: In scientific areas, I lack so many knowledges, even some potentially important concepts related to catalysts and electrochemistry. I need to consider in the Reading 
- 12:55pm: hungry, eat an apple. Why get hungry so quickly?
- 1:24 pm, sleepy after 1.5 h meeting
- 2:58pm, Feel starving and very sleepy from 1pm to 2 pm. This is the period when the group meeting happens usually. I tried to fall asleep without having any food. Fortunately, I did fall asleep. I was waken up after 22 minutes as usual. But still starving to death. Eat 350 g salad. The stomach feels not comfortable. The acid is rolling in stomach and I am feeling acid reflux. Not happy with this.
    - First, the starving problem should be attributed to unenough food by 350 g for each meal. This amount can’t cover the total energy consuming. So the hungry starts to accumulate until this noon when I feel starving at 1pm. So try to increase the amount of each meal to be 400g. 
    - Second, I estimate my endurance too optimistically for working without rest intervals especially at the last hour of awake period. In the suggested time schedule, I arrange the sleep to be after two-hours meeting. But actually I can’t afford that. So on Friday, or when there is a long meeting, move the sleep forward. Just to sleep half an hour before the meeting to make sure I have enough energy for that.
- 5:38 pm: Tired, but not bad. Already “Worked” for 10h 31min. Consider “Reading” during the next interval.
- 6:17 pm: Recover 70%. Heart rate 64 /min. Feel heart unconfortable, or maybe stomache.
- 7:03pm: Not tired, but bored. Suffer from gastrosia, meaning too much acid in my stomach. Take two tablets of hydrotalcite. Consider to remove vinegar from the meal. That could be the reason for gastrosia.
    - Get bored with “Work”. Switch to “Reading”.
- 7:30pm: Get bored with reading “Python crash course” book. 
- 7:50pm: After doing yoga, feel better. I am feeling bad because excessive acid in my stomach. 
    - Google why high stomach acid? The reason could be the salad that I eat. In today’s salad, I ate too much starch, including about 300 g potatoes and 300 g cooked rice. Starch can cause digest problem and irritate the stomach to generate high acid. So consider to remove potatoes in the following several days, and cut down the amount in the future.
- 10:55pm: Finish another sleep. Meal 350g salad without potatoes. Take one extra bullet of hydrotalcite. Feel not bad.
    - But still, I feel pressure and anxious by the to-do list in Omnifocus. More accurately, on my hart. Now I already reach the limit of time efficiency. I can’t increase the work time anymore. So something is wrong with the task management, not the time management. 
    - And also, I need to find happiness within this new time schedule. Now, I feel more like pressure. When I am writing this note, I imagine that many people will read it and criticize it. But that’s not the truth. Will I read such a long blog from others day by day? If I do, the bloger should thank me, not feel pressure. I admire his contribution to the exploration of time management. He is very creative. 
    - Make my life full of happiness, this is the most important part of next steps. 
- 11:25am The way to find happiness:
    - Behave proudly when I should be. Be happy when I am indeed happy.
    - I am merely an ordinary guy, so no need to become great. 
    - Feel relaxed and enjoy what I am doing. No need to make everything perfect. Only need to make it just right.
    - No shame at faults, instead, laugh at myself when I do make faults. To be happy is more important to be always right and perfect.
