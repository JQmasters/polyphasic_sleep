## Log

- 4:26am: I thought I had  a bad 22-minute sleep, so when awake, I tried to fall into another 22-mute sleep. Failed. It’s not possible.
    - So when experiencing a bad sleep, get up first. When feeling tired again, try the second 22-minute sleep. Due to the bad previous sleep, the second one should come earlier. It’s okay to ignore the time schedule. Sleep based on the feeling.
