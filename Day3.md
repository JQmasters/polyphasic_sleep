## Summary of today

- The weight of each meal should be increased to 350 g. 300g can’t support me until the next sleep period.
- I actually am asleep even though I feel awake. Or it’s possible that I totally lost my feeling during the deep sleep.
- The secret to fall asleep quickly:
    - Turn off the all lights. Wear earplugs. Wear eye cover if it’s not totally dark. Wear less clothes and walk around the bed until the first yawn comes.
    - Lie down on bed. Adjust the posture until feeling comfortable. Focus on every breathe, and try to slow it down, and try to relax your back into the soft bed. Meditate in the heart, “relax and slow down.” Repeat it again and again. 
    - Any worries can ruin the deep sleep. Write them down before sleep, or even make a short plan to deal with it. Try to remove every unpleasant thought (or anxiety) from the mind.
- Summary today’s time map. Limit the “Work” time to be 10 h as maximum. Or 9 h, need to try this. Add one hobby (Reading). Reading here means to read classic literature, not scientific literatures or textbooks. When feel boring with “Work”, switch to “Reading”. Can lean on a pillow to relax the back. Take quick notes when reading. This is a serious hobby and intends to prepare me as an author. The current book is *Pride and Prejudice*, written by Jane Austen, Chinese version. I can afford to buy more paperback books ( English version) when find some interesting ones. For “Reading” activity, always select paper books to reduce the time sitting before computer and iPad screens, to protect my eyes.

| Date  | Work    | Sleep  | Exercise | Chores  | Reading | Fun   |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| 03-18 | 9h38min | 6h8min | 14min    | 6h42min | 34min   | 40min |

- The tired feeling at 11:25am can be attributed to low-quality sleep at 8:50am, due to the worry to miss the meeting at 10 am. It could also be part of interest lost, when I continuously spent several hours on similar research work. 

- So it’s very important to add a new activity of “Reading”. I would expect this activity can occupy 4-5 hours per day, taking charge of the spare time when “Sleep” can be reduced to about 3 hours (2.2 hour for sleep time, plus some unexpected time consuming).
- I explained my sleep plan to my families and got the support from them.
- Ordered digital thermometer and blood pressure monitor to keep track of my body data, including weight, body temperature, blood pressure. Also consider to include the nutrition data, but need some time to calculate it.
- Body data of today:
    - Body temperature 36.4 ℃, weight 76.8 Kg. 

## Log

- 12:53 am Feel a little hungry. Maybe 300g per meal is not enough. Feel a little tired but good.
- 1:09am Too hungry. Eat a half box of strawberries.
- 1:15am The strawberries are too cold. Not sure if I will have diarrhea. Anyway, back to work.
- **2:45am Finished another sleep. Weird thing is that I don’t think I really fall asleep. I can feel I was always awake. Maybe I entered a status of meditation instead of deep sleep. Really? I am confused.** 
    - **I tried hard to fall asleep, trying to relax my back into the bed and relax my breath. But I can always feel the inside response, like relaxation, shallow and slow breath, the movement of belly. I just forgot the sense to the outside environment and lost the feeling to time. Is this really a sleep?**
    - **Feel good now, but very confused.** 
    - **Even not sleepy. I don’t feel like to go to sleep again. Get fully recovered already.**
- 3:03am Eat 360 g salad, feel just right. Back to work. But after half an hour, need to do yoga. I am feeling backache. 
- 3:29am Feel good. Too good to be true. I can still do creative thinking. Marvelous. Still confused what did I experience during the last “sleep”. The current status is too good. Am I in a dream right now?
- 3:59am I was happy when I felt tired before doing yoga. But after yoga, I am feeling energetic again. What’s wrong with me? When I followed the 7.5 monophasic sleep pattern, the similar situations never happened. I am a little afraid with such a good status. This is too good to be true.
- 4:33 am Tired. This is normal. I need to stay up for 1.5 hours. 
    - But when I started to work, and found something interesting. Again, l didn’t feel sleepy any more. So…, what’s wrong with me? During the monophasic sleep, tired is tired. No way I can do to get recovered unless taking sleep. But now… I totally don’t understand. Where did these energy and brainpower come from? Am I over-exploiting my body energy and brainpower, and health?
- 5:13am Feel a little tired, but can maintain normal thinking ability. 
- 5:39am Go to sleep. The next sleep is 9am -9:25am, then meeting at 10am - 11am.
- 6:25am Get up as planned. Have a meal of bread, milk and two eggs. Feel a little more tired than previous get-up. Okay, it seems I can easily feel tired during the morning period. Don't know the reason. 
    - I will try to do something instead of continuing the research work.
    - This time I did fall asleep, without feeling awake. When I heard the alarm, feel unhappy and would like to turn it off and keep sleeping. Good news is that, when I turned off the alarms and turn on the light. I feel more clear and less sleepy. Then feel hungry. It’s full of happiness that I can eat when hungry. 
    - Anyway, no more worries about whether falling asleep or not. I did when I really need it.
    - It could possible to be that I was afraid to miss the meeting again before sleep, which hindered my deep sleep.
- 7:05am Too tired after one Pomodoro period. Try to do something else instead of research.
- 7:23am Feel much better after listening to some beautiful musics. Music helps the brain to relax. Back to work.
- 8:21am Feel tired. Still half an hour away from the next sleep slot. 
    - After washing face and brushing teeth, feel better. But I am close to the “boring” point.
- 9:22am The next sleep was 8:50am-9:14am. Feel not too bad. Still feel tired now. Hungry but have a slightly less appetite. I am missing my bed and want to lie on bed again. 
    - Choose to listen to music. I need some comfort. 
- 9:44am Feel better, but still not free of tiredness. And I lose interest when I have spent more than 10 hours on similar research stuffs and python programming. Bored.
- 11:25am Feel bad, tired, headache. Feel reluctant to work, talk and cook. Want to sleep. Can I go to sleep. Is the tiredness accumulating after each sleep? Feel less patient to do things. I start to doubt whether I can really form such an “unconventional”, crazy sleep pattern. 
    - I want to sleep. 
- 11:40am Doesn’t feel good after listening to musics. I really need to sleep. So take an extra 22 minutes. 
- 4:13pm This sleep lasted for 4 hours 27 minutes, from 11:36am to 4:04pm. Okay, 11:36am is not very accurate, but this not the main problem. The main question is, why I didn’t get up after the 22-min alarm? I kind of lost the memory about that time.
    - Currently feel unclear of mind. I lost clear and detailed memories about what happened at around 12 pm. The current status makes me feel not good. My body is still at the sleeping mode, and will take about half an hour to get recovered. Compared to the status when I got up after 22-minute sleep, the current status definitely is not good. It makes me feel dizzy, sleepy, and lazy. It makes me tend to go to bed and lie down although I can’t sleep anymore. I feel hungry but less reactive. I am feeling stomachache because of hunger, but lazy to prepare food. 
    - Another finding is that, I am losing short-period memory during the period of just getting up. It’s hard to recall every details happened after I got up at 4:13pm. 
    - I also lost some self-control ability to make me follow the right things, like eat properly, washing dishes right after the meal. What I am the most likely to do now, is lying on bed and watching movies for fun. 
    - It’s already 4:50pm, but my brain is still not activated. Dizzy, full of something else (not the right things, like self control, following the rules, interests in research and learning, etc). I don’t like the current status. I can’b believe this is what normally called “healthy” routine, in which I sleep for several hours to get recovered but turn out to watching movies, lying on bed, after I get “enough” sleep. **I am starting to suspect that human brains actually can get used to polyphasic mode, by birth.** Why after “enough” sleep, my brain turns out  to select having fun instead of working or housekeeping, to make my life better? Brain itself, or the instinct can’t understand the future, and gives the “bad” response. The human instinct likes more food, so we eat excessively; it likes relaxation, so we hesitate to work, and prefer lying on bed, watching movies, and so we hate physical exercises and prefer lying or sitting down. Thus, how can I believe that my body really need such a long sleep like 4 hours, or 7.5 hours, or 9 hours? My body can lie to me when it wants to be lazy. 
    - I am feeling acid reflux in my stomach. It has been empty during 4 hours sleep. I don’ t believe that my stomach really likes it, but just the brain asleep can’t response to it. **Now I start to believe that 6 small meals a day, is better than 3 bigger meals per day**. 
    - Back to my performance in the new sleep mode. At 11:40 am, when I said feeling tired. It is real. To go to bed and have 22 sleep is not a bad idea. But probably, to help my body to get used to the new sleep mode, I should have stayed up until 2 pm. 
    - 5:15 pm, currently, my brain starts to become more clear. So it took the brain and body about one hour to finally get activated after a longer sleep. I don’ think it’s because of tiredness. The common belief is that human body needs several hours’ sleep to get recovery. But why do I still feel dizzy after a long sleep? When googling it, many people say, it’s normal. WHAT? It’s ridiculous. If an animal lives with such a sleep mode, it could probably be hunted by the predator. So to sleep 4 hours and then take 1 hour to get the full energy recovered, is kind of a waste of time. It’s something like we first fill a balloon with excessive gas, and when it’s full, we release parts of the gas to have the balloon feel better. We are wasting the gas and the time on sleep, right?
- Well, anyway, the failure in this afternoon, makes me to think that I am following a biologically correct sleep pattern, which is not fully accepted by human due to historical reasons. So feel relax about the correctness of polyphasic sleeping mode. I am doing the right thing. And try to switch between two different kinds of subjects instead of just research and programming, like music and research, or yoga and research. I need to try them out. 
    - For the next time when I feel very tired, try first switch to another subject. 
- 5:46 pm, okay, I am back from a 10-minute break. I think during the last three days, I worked on research too much and was experiencing burnout. Mar. 16, work 11h 47min, Mar. 17, work 10h 41min, Mar. 18 (today), work 8h 7 min (and there still are 6 hours left ). After working too long on just one thing, my interests are burned out. That could be one reason making me feel very tired. Let first try to only work 10 hours per day. I need to set up a new event in the TimeGolden. 
    - So, what should I do? 1. Reading books not related to python, programming, DFT, or any scientific engineering. The classic literature, not limited to China’s or America’s authors. Literatures like novels, poems are very different from scientific or engineering books. It can be a very good choice. 2. Music, I mean, learn to play musical instrument. I have been considering to learn playing pianos for years, but don’t have the condition previously. A digital piano can be a good choice. 3. Movies, but I can’t learn much. It’s more like for fun. I will feel guilty. 4. More….
    - After googling, and comparing, select reading. I used to enjoy reading when I was a kids. I can read  scientific novels for a whole day at that time. Now, I need to correlate my reading experiences to my writing skills. To become a good author, can be my “second job”. Let me try it right now.

- 6:54pm I tried to read, *Pride and Prejudice*, written by Jane Austen, Chinese version. I took this pocket book with me when I first came to USA on 2017. But I have found time to read during the last years. Well, definitely I had time, but didn’t find the reason that I should do it. Now I did.
    -  I took notes when reading, as I took it as a serious interest. I feel quite good right now. 
        - Main problem is that, I prefer paper books instead of electronic ones. It would be a large expense to buy paper books. Oh, it’s not too bad. Amazon.com is selling the English version by \$9.99 for paperback.  I can afford it. One book can take more than one month for me to read and enjoy. I can accept to pay as much as \$100 each month for my main interest. 
    - Now I feel refreshed, and ready to continue research work and python programming again. Thanks to my childhood interest. So to switch between research work and reading(&writing, writing has not been tested yet, but to write this note has no help) does help me to maintain my interests. Let me see whether I can make this sleep pattern work with the help of reading. 
- 7:24pm, okay, I feel very good. Again I feel the energized focus called “flow”. This is the highest happiest time for me. Thanks for excellent authors, thanks to their excellent books. 
- 9:46pm, Talked to my families about this sleep experiment, and they support me to do this as long as I feel good. 
    - So I consider to make this experiment more precise.
    - Measure the axillary temperature (my normal temperature is 36.5℃), but I still need to measure a baseline for several days, to see how much it is fluctuating.
        - Use a standard mercury thermometer. Put the measure point in the middle of armpit.
    - Measure the blood pressure, also need to measure a baseline for several days.
    - Measure the body weight, also need to measure a baseline for several days.
    - Then keep track of the time spent on different categories. 
    - Calculate the food nutration and colories. 
    - Define the sign ready for sleeping: walk in the dark, when the first yawn comes. 
- 10 pm: body temperature 36.4 ℃
- 10:58 pm: body weight 76.8 Kg, measured after getting up. Slept from 10:15-10:41, still a timer of 22 minutes. Have 350 g salad.
