## Summary of today

- The content of daily notes was cut down today and continues to be in the future, unless something important happens. Now I have a general idea how to perform polyphasic sleep. So if there is nothing new, I will not repeat the same feedback, like “good”,  “a little tired”,  etc. 

- As I said, I am trying to care more about the feeling of happiness, instead of the time consumption. This makes me more relaxed and much happier. I can fall into the [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) much more easily. And this should be one of the most important reasons of happiness.

- Another thing is that my stomachache stopped, after I started to eat freshly prepared food, instead of reheated one kept in refrigerator. Not sure whether the food is the reason, or what’s the difference between freshly prepared food and refrigerator kept food.

## Log

- 6:43am From 2:30am to now, I didn’t take notes. I still followed the polyphasic sleep. 2:10-2:30am, 5:57-6:32am. 
    - Feel not bad. But during the sleep around 6am, I was a little hard to fall to deep sleep. The reason could be too excited after I fix a bug issue in my python script. I spent the about 3 hours this morning on writing scripts. I didn’t feel lost of creative thinking or memories. 
    - But it’s true that I could feel tired more easily than 7.5h sleep.
- 8am Feel tired and sleepy. Fell a little stomachache and slightly toothache, more sensitive to heat or cold water. I am possibly experiencing sleep deprivation.
    - 8:21am can’t think. Very sleepy, my brain stops working. To take sleep.
- 1:44pm: Slept from 8:20am to 8:47am, and then 8:49am to 1:37pm. The first 22-minutes happened for the first trial, but it was not enough. Okay, let me first recall the feelings at that time. Around 8:21am, I  can barely think, (was writing a python script at that time, but couldn’t figure it out. My brainpower dropped very quickly in several minutes.) Besides, felt a little heart with my heart or maybe stomach, which I could distinguish. It was nothing about what I ate, but should be due to tiredness. 
    - On day5, a similar tiredness happened and slept from 2:16am to 8:20am, while on day6, it was from 8:20am to 1:37pm. 
    - The common part of these two days is that I took the long sleep without any alarm, and I felt asleep in one minute, lasting 6h4min (day5) and 5h14min (day6). 
    - Currently, I can still feel a little ache with my stomach (probably, the heart rate is 64 bpm, and beat regularly, I don’t think anything is wrong with my heart) and teeth (still sensitive to cold and hot water). First this means a long period of sleep doesn’t help to fix these. The ache of my stomach and teeth has little relationship with sleep depreciation. 
    - What about brain power? OnDay5, I felt asleep by accident,  waking up at 8:47am and working until 2pm. The next tiredness came at 12:49pm, about 4 hours after a sleep of 6h4min. The feeling of brainpower had no different with the periods of polyphasic sleep intervals.  On Day6, I first tried a sleep with an excessive 20 minutes from 8:20am to 8:47am. The brainpower should have come back, but I was still feeling sleepy, possibly due to laziness of the body at the first minutes of getting up. So I switched off the alarms and went to bed again without any alarm. I can’t tell any difference between the sleep of 22-minute and about 6-hour on the recovery of brain power.
    - But what made difference is the feeling of my stomach. It ached more often than before when I took one long sleep at night and ate three meals a day. Is it because during the monophasic sleep mode, my stomach could take more time for rest, while during the polyphasic sleep mode, it has to work six times a day, and has less rest time. 
    - If this is true that only the stomach hinders the execution of polyphasic sleep mode, I can probably try to find other ways to protect my stomach and have it feel better, like massage, heat treatment, and medicine, etc. 
    - Finally, I decide to continue with the polyphasic sleep mode. And in the future, try not going to bed due to the reason of lack brain power. Instead, try something easier and stay up until the next time slot for polyphasic sleep. But I definitely need find some way to deal with my stomachache. 
- **4:17pm: Massage on the right acupoints does help to relieve the stomach.** 
    - **And I will also try to cook (boil) vegetables and meat (or tofu) for immediate consumption, instead of preparing them ahead and keep in refrigerator. 200 vegetables + 100 g meat or tofu + 50 g cooked rice.** This is to reduce the amount of possible bacterials in the prepared meals. As I learned, bacterials still grow when the meal is kept in refrigerator.
- 7:51pm: **My stomach feel much better now. The reason could be I started today (from 2pm around) to eat freshly prepared food (cooked in the same way), instead of reheated salad kept in refrigerator. Also could be due to the longer sleep this morning from 8am to 1 pm. I need time to verify this.**
- 2:39am (Mar.22): I skipped the sleep at 10 pm tonight by taking a shower, without obvious tiredness.
