## Summary of today

- Sleep through 5 hours, but still feel not as good as a 22-minute sleep. After a long sleep, I need more time to get recovered to the peak performance.

    - I guess that longer sleep is more important to the psychological health (can make me feel happy and relaxed), but less efficient to the recovery of brainpower (would take much longer to reach the peak performance).

- 23-minute sleep also works.

    Time consumption is not important.

## Log

- 2:23-2:45am: slept，but felt sleepy after getting up.
- 2:45-4am: can’t concentrate on mental work. Feel less happy.
- 4-6am: entertainment (watching videos), I can only concentrate on this.
- 6-11am: sleep, feel dizzy, and bad. Good news is no stomachache any more. Had crazy and tiring dreams, feel neck-ache, and regret to sleep so long.
    - Reading. But not the classic literature, although I intended to do. It seems that I reject the classic literature because they are less “useful”. Maybe consider reading scientific literatures as a switch from work and python?
- 11:48am: Feel better, but still not the peak. 48 minutes are not enough. So longer sleep tends to have low efficient in the recovering of physical status. Maybe longer sleep is more important to the mental and psychological health.
    - Hard to concentrate, and easily lose control on my thoughts.
- 12:41pm: Feel tired, but I don’t think I need to sleep. 
- 2:31pm: after a 30-minute walk outside, feel much more clear. I guess walk would also help when I have 2.2 hour sleep per day. Need to try this.
- 9:37pm: slept from 6:02pm to 9:14pm. Got up first after 22-minute, but failed to get me back to work. Seemed like losing interest to anything listed in OmnoFocus. So try to sleep. 
    - Sleep worked. It helped me to recover the interests, to everything. 
    - I don’t know the reason, but now that it is useful. A hybrid sleep mode should be considered. When I feel energetic, take the polyphasic sleep mode (22minute every four hours), when I lost interest, take a long sleep until getting recovered.
    - Maybe, a longer sleep is needed when I feel overwhelmed with the ideas on my mind. Today, after the meeting, in the afternoon, I need to adjust many task listed on Omnifocus, which made my mind overwhelmed. Maybe only a few, but human brain tends to image the situation more difficult. GTD task management system is really helpful. 
    - The most important task, right now, is to review the task list. To be clear what I should do is very important.
