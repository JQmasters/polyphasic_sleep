## Summary of today

- add to Meal: eat fruit at 4pm, can be: a small apple, or orange, or half box of strawberry. 
- Never increase the timer to be longer than 25min (including the time going to bed, lying down, sleep, and waking up to turn off the alarms). 
- One benefit is that this sleep pattern makes me more decisive and talkative, and it could also have increased my ability of quick learning.

## Log

- 3 am: will the meal plan (divided to 6 meals) do harm to my stomach? 
    - Google it. The stomach empties itself within 1-4 hours, depending on the kind of food. It’s definitely harmful to overeat. But there is no consensus about regular short amount of eating. 
    - Based on my feeling, I feel good with my stomach. No ache, no acid reflux.
    - So keep this meal plan.
- 4:39 am: Eyes are very tired. Need to massage and heat treatment on eyes.
- 12pm: failed to get up at 6:30am. Slept from 6 am to 10:39 am. The reason is that I increase the timer to 30 min. 
    - Sleep cycle has very clear effects. The best wake-up slots are 22-25min (including the time going to bed, lying down, sleep, and waking up to turn off the alarms). 
- **5 pm: too talkative, too excited. Can’t explain why. Maybe because I really feel boring. But this can’t explain why I became a quick learner. Compared to previous meetings, in today’s meeting, I can quickly focus on the single points interesting me. In previous meetings, I would like to know every details but often get overwhelmed during a short period.** 
    - **Another finding is that I feel more brave to talk, instead of thinking twice and then feel hesitated to speak out. The reason could be that my brain feels that it should not waste energies on thinking twice, so it turns me more decisive.** 
    - **Really interesting findings. It appears that human brains can alter the behavior pattern according to the living situations. In more serious situations (limited food and energies), humans probably turned to be less patient and more aggressive. But in better living situations, when there is enough food, and people can have enough sleep and relaxation, they probably turn to be more tolerant and generous.** 
- 6:46pm Have salad of 300 g.
- 7:44pm Feel hungry. It seems 300 g is not enough for the meal at 6:30pm, but not to increase the meal amount any more. Eat fruit at 4 pm. 
- 8:40pm Starving, and can’t focus my concentration. After eating a half box of strawberries, fell good. Back to work. Not tired, no headache.
- 10:13pm Finish massage the neck and back. Massage the eyes and use a steam eye cover when massaging the neck and back and when doing Yoga. Feel good now. Feel less tired than usual but still go to bed for 22 minutes sleeping.
- 10:58 pm Complete anther 22-minute sleep. And have a meal of 300 g salad. Feel refreshed. But the massage before the sleep is not good. It made me feel less tired and then harder to fall asleep. During this 22 minutes of sleep, I felt like awake for a long time and then heard the alarm. I need to adjust the time for massage.
- 12:22am (Mar. 18): Feel good. Not feel boring like yesterday, highly related to the meeting in the afternoon. **I feel relaxed after talking to others, compared to working alone yesterday.**
