## Summary of today

- It seems hard to maintain the sleep mode (22min every 4 hours). Today, I took an extra ~4 hours sleep in the morning, due to mental or psychological reasons. I am a little hesitated whether I should keep the original plan. It made me feel unhappy sometimes, while sleep can comfort that feeling.

## Log

- 1:02pm Slept 2:13am - 2:36am, then 6:34am-6:58am, then 6:58am - 11:57am. The third long sleep came not because any sleep depreciation or tiredness. It’s kind of when I want to take a vacation, then I do. It should be okay if I can get up and back to work. But the work in the early morning from 12am to 6:30am was so hard, which made me less interested to be back to work right now.
    - And yes, I was trying to find an excuse. The main reason should be that my mind was not very clear when I was in the dark, turning off the alarms, and then lay down on bed for a short rest. It also could be that I was satisfied with the working experience in the early morning. Anyway, I slept with no regret, but this “vacation” can be skipped if something serious happened. 
- 9:42pm: After changing the meal to freshly prepared ones, I never feel any stomach problems.
